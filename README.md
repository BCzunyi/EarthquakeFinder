# EarthquakeFinder
Project 2 for Android Class 2015
Please note that I implement everything I discribed in Assignment 1 as well as a GPS button to allow for
easy searching at the users current location.
Please note that the Google Maps API will not work on your emulator and as such you must put my app on your
phone in order to fully test it.
Please also note that the Google Maps authentication is also devide dependent.
